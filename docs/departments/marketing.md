## Social Media

- Social Media staff is responsible for posting informtion and graphics to X (formerly twitter), youtube and other socials. The goal is to make our Social Medias a "one stop shop" for new info, easily digestable and interactable sections for match dates, holiday graphics, and Sponsorship updates, among others. 

- For access to MLE's Socials, contact Spike to grant you access. (for example, on X we add your account as a "delegate", this permission is something only Director+ can give you.)

- MLEs standards for quality are high, but not impossible for the inexperinced to achieve. We ask that graphics and videos follow the same "vibe" and "atmosphere", so that styles dont clash week to week, or even post to post. you can expirament and be creative while also keeping a consistent style, think outside the box! 

- This should go without saying, but dont post anything that will get MLE on the news (in a bad way), no offensive or vulgar content, all posts must fall within the MLE guidelines as well as the guidelines of the platform you are using. exersise common sense please! if you are unsure, err on the side of caution or get approval from Coordinator+. 

- For new Social media staff, have Spike add you to the Google Drive for MLE assets for use in image and video editing / creation. please note that these assets are ONLY for use within official an official MLE capacity, and the assets themselves are not to be edited directly. for examples or if you are unsure if your idea falls outside these boundries, have Team Lead+ review it on a case by case basis. 

- Once your graphic, post, video, etc is ready to ship, share it in your teams respective Discord channel and get the "green light" before clicking post. 


## Sponsorships

- This department is responsible for maintaining current sponsorships, seeking out new ones, fulfilling orders and keeping winners updated on the current status of their winnings. This department also works alongside the Merch department for any merch related winnings s determined by our Fourthwall store or our Jersey store Gurdian Proline. 

## Merchandise

- This department is responsible for the creation of new Merch, the design of products in our Fourthwall store, our relationship with Guardian Proline, as well as finding ways to implement community ideas for merchandise. 

- For new Merch staff, please have Coordinator+ add you as an "editor" on our fourthwall store. From here, you can create new merch, edit individual teams merch, create discount codes, create custom "collections", and browse hundreds of customizable items to sell. 

- Historically, for new merch rollouts we go by Division as to not overload out team. 4 teams at a time is easier than 32 all at once.
