## Important Info
- Season Schedule - Each team plays each other 1 time over 7 weeks then week 8 they play their equal in the other conference. 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3, 4 vs 4.
    Maps - 10 maps. 5 maps for first 4 weeks then maps switch to other 5 maps. 
         
    Match Format - Teams play 5 maps where each map is played in rounds until 1 team has 5 points. Points are earned for placement. 1st = 6, 2nd = 5, 3rd = 4, and so on.  
          First map is pre picked for each match week then the team that loses the map will pick the next map. This continues until all 5 maps are played.
          Teams win rounds by scoring more points than their opponents. For example: T1 places 1/3/6 and T2 places 2/4/5. T1 earns 6/4/1 points or 11 total. T2 earns 5/3/2 points or 10 total.
              T1 wins this round.

    Scrim Format - Players play in a 4 person FFA format on 3 maps
          Maps are randomly selected by scrim bot before scrim begins. 
          Players play rounds on a map until 1 player reaches 10 points. Points are earned for placement. 1st = 4, 2nd = 3, 3rd = 2, 4th = 1. 
              Once a player reaches 10, they go on to the next map in the selected set.
